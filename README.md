# Deep Learning (PyTorch)

This repository contains projects completed at Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). Each project consists of a jupyter notebook where all the required code is present and all the assests required to run the project. Each project also has a html form of the notebook, so you can easily download it to view the code without opening jupyter notebook. 

# Project description

1. [Dog breed classifier](https://github.com/ishgirwan/udacity_dlnd/tree/master/Dog%20Breed%20Classifier): Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine's breed. The project also buids a pipeline to process real world user supplie dimages.

2. [Generate TV scripts](https://github.com/ishgirwan/udacity_dlnd/tree/master/Generate%20TV%20scripts): Generate a TV script by defining and training a recurrent neural network.

3. [Generate faces](https://github.com/ishgirwan/udacity_dlnd/tree/master/Face%20Generation): Define two adversarial networks (GANs), a generator and a discriminator, and train them to generate realistic faces.

4. [Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model using Amazon Sagemaker](https://github.com/ishgirwan/udacity_dlnd/tree/master/Deploying%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20model%20-%20Amazon%20Sagemaker): Build and deploy a RNN to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews complete with publicly accessible API and a simple web page which interacts with the deployed endpoint.
