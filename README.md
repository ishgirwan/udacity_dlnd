# Deep Learning (PyTorch)

This repository contains projects completed at Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). Each project consists of a jupyter notebook where all the required code is present and all the assests required to run the project. Each project also has a html form of the notebook, so you can easily download it to view the code without opening jupyter notebook. 

# Project description

1. Dog breed classifier: Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine's breed. The project also buids a pipeline to process real world user supplie dimages.

2. Generate TV scripts: Generate a TV script by defining and training a recurrent neural network.

3. Generate faces: Define two adversarial networks (GANs), a generator and a discriminator, and train them to generate realistic faces.

4. Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model using Amazon Sagemaker: Build and deploy a RNN to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews complete with publicly accessible API and a simple web page which interacts with the deployed endpoint.
